Designing a comprehensive and scalable subscription service with advanced features such as free trials, tiered membership pricing, and restrictions on free memberships involves several key components. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for such a service:

Key Features

1. User Management: Handle user registration, login, and profile management.
2. Subscription Plans: Define various subscription plans with different pricing and feature sets.
3. Free Trials: Implement a free trial period (e.g., 15 days) that automatically transitions to a paid plan.
4. Tiered Membership Pricing: Charge based on the number of members (e.g., free for up to 4 members, charges apply for 5 or more).
5. Restrictions on Free Memberships: Ensure one company cannot have multiple free memberships.
6. Billing Cycles: Manage monthly, quarterly, and yearly billing cycles.
7. Prorated Billing: Handle prorated charges for upgrades and downgrades.
8. Feature Access Management: Control access to features based on subscription plans.
9. Audit Logs: Maintain logs of all subscription changes and transactions for audit purposes.
